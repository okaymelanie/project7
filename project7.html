  <h2>A person I admire (Past or Present) </h2>
    <p> A person I admire is Walt Disney. He made my childhood amazing with all his movies and he's such an inspiration to me. He was 65 years old when he sadly passed away. My favorite movie he made is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. A favorite quote of his is "If you can dream it, you can do it."
